/*
Scenario 1: When a user is coming to stake and there's no stake in the staking pool,
the updateReward sets everything to 0 because
rewardForEachTokenStaked = 0 because rewardPerToken() returns 0 into rewardForEachTokenStaked because
     if (totalStake == 0) {
            return rewardForEachTokenStaked;
        }... at this point, rewardForEachTokenStaked = 0 hence it returns 0;
rewards[_account] = 0 because earned() returns 0 because balanceOf[_account] = 0;
userRewardPerTokenPaid[_account] is set to 0 because rewardForEachTokenStaked which is 0 is used to set it hence it is equal to 0;

Scenario 2: When a user is coming to stake when there's stake int the staking pool.
in the updateReward, the rewardPerToken() sets the the rewardForEachTokenStaked using
1. (rewardRate * (lastTimeRewardApplicable() - updateAt(the last time there was an update)) for the calculation
2. updateAt = lastTimeRewardApplicable(): (this is either the current time or the endOfDuration, depending on the on the one that's lower)
3. rewards[_account] = earned(_account); earned() is used to update the user rewards[user]
4. userRewardPerTokenPaid[_account] = rewardForEachTokenStaked(which is actually the last rewardPerToken())

HOW TO USE
1. Deploy 2 ERC-20 contract
2. Copy their addresses into the staking contract
3. Once the staking contract is deployed, the first thing is for the owner of the contract to set the staking duration.
4. After setting the staking duration, it's to call the notifyRewardAmount function which sets the reward rate bt before that is done,
    you need to transfer reward token into the staking contract.
5. Mint some tokens to the owner and the owner tranfers it to the staking contract.
6. This amount is then used to call the notifyRewardAmount function.
7. Once the notifyRewardAmount function is called and the reward rate is set, stakers can then come to stake.
8. Some tokens are met to the staker from the staking ERC-20. He brings the token to the staking contracts, and stake.
9. After staking, he can check his balance staked from balanceOf function.
10. He can check the amount of rewards he has gotten over time
11. He can get his reward, which he can check in his erc-20 contract
12. He can withdraw his stake from the staking contract which reflect in his ERC-20 token wallet/contract
